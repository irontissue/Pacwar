Next, I took the top 10 genes from the above list, and continued mutating on these genes. I set up a parameter
that allows me to begin each iteration with the previous strongest gene, and mutate it from there. I also relaxed the
constraints for strictly beating to minimum score of 11 versus each gene, so that I can find improvements more often.
This resulted in this list of top 10:

We see that the Rank 10 gene, which got heavily smoked, was actually previously considered a very good gene (Gene 16
from earlier).

I decided to test the  chance that the best genes I've found so far are on a plateau and there are other hidden genes.
I restarted the entire iteration algorithm from scratch, having it find better genes by itself on a completely new set.
The results were surprising after around 15 iterations:

Rank 1, avg score 15.7: [0, 3, 1, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 3, 0, 1, 0, 0, 3, 1, 0, 0, 3, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 0, 3, 2, 1, 3, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1].
Rank 2, avg score 15.7: [0, 3, 1, 3, 0, 3, 1, 0, 0, 0, 2, 1, 3, 2, 2, 0, 3, 0, 1, 3, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 0, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 0, 3, 1, 0, 0, 1, 3, 1, 1, 3, 1].
Rank 3, avg score 14.0: [0, 1, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 3, 1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 2, 3, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 1, 3, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 1, 3].
Rank 4, avg score 10.8: [3, 3, 3, 2, 0, 0, 3, 0, 3, 0, 3, 1, 2, 2, 2, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 2, 3, 3, 2, 3, 2, 2, 3, 3, 2, 3, 2, 2, 3, 2, 2, 3, 2, 1, 0, 3, 1, 0, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 3, 3].
Rank 5, avg score 9.7: [3, 3, 3, 2, 0, 0, 3, 0, 1, 3, 3, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 0, 2, 3, 3, 2, 3, 2, 2, 3, 3, 2, 3, 2, 2, 3, 2, 2, 3, 2, 1, 0, 3, 1, 3, 3, 2, 0, 3, 1, 1, 0].
Rank 6, avg score 8.5: [3, 3, 3, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 1, 3, 3, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 0, 2, 3, 2, 2, 3, 2, 2, 3, 3, 2, 3, 2, 2, 3, 2, 2, 3, 2, 1, 0, 3, 1, 3, 3, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0].
Rank 7, avg score 6.5: [3, 3, 3, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 3, 3, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 2, 3, 2, 2, 3, 2, 2, 3, 3, 2, 3, 2, 2, 3, 2, 2, 3, 2, 1, 0, 3, 1, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0].
Rank 8, avg score 4.8: [3, 3, 3, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 2, 3, 2, 2, 3, 2, 2, 3, 3, 2, 3, 2, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 2, 1, 0, 3, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0].
Rank 9, avg score 2.7: [3, 3, 3, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 2, 3, 2, 2, 3, 2, 2, 3, 3, 2, 3, 2, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 2, 1, 0, 3, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0].
Rank 10, avg score 1.6: [3, 3, 3, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 2, 3, 2, 2, 3, 2, 2, 3, 3, 2, 3, 2, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 2, 1, 0, 3, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0]

We can see that there is a marked difference between ranked 1-3 and 4-10. In fact, the algorithm took a LONG time to
find the rank 3 gene, and it looks very familiar to the set of very strong genes I found in my older posts. Coincidence?
Running it more on the same set resulted in these results, and then a plateau:

[0, 1, 3, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 3, 1, 1, 3, 3, 3, 2, 3, 3, 2, 3, 3, 2, 2, 3, 2, 2, 3, 2, 2, 3, 1, 3, 3, 1, 3, 1, 1, 0, 3, 1, 3]
[0, 1, 3, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 3, 2, 3, 2, 3, 3, 2, 3, 3, 2, 2, 3, 2, 3, 3, 2, 2, 3, 1, 3, 3, 1, 3, 1, 1, 2, 3, 1, 3]
[0, 1, 3, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 3, 1, 0, 0, 2, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 3, 1, 3, 2, 3, 3, 2, 3, 3, 2, 2, 3, 2, 2, 3, 2, 2, 3, 1, 3, 3, 1, 3, 0, 1, 0, 3, 1, 0]
[0, 1, 3, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 3, 1, 3, 2, 3, 3, 2, 3, 3, 2, 2, 3, 2, 2, 3, 2, 2, 3, 1, 3, 3, 1, 3, 0, 1, 0, 3, 1, 0]
[0, 1, 3, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 3, 0, 1, 3, 1, 3, 2, 3, 3, 2, 3, 3, 2, 2, 3, 2, 2, 3, 2, 2, 3, 1, 3, 3, 1, 3, 3, 1, 0, 3, 1, 0]
[0, 1, 3, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 2, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 3, 3, 3, 2, 3, 3, 2, 3, 3, 2, 2, 3, 2, 2, 3, 2, 2, 3, 1, 3, 3, 1, 3, 1, 1, 0, 3, 1, 0]
[0, 1, 3, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 1, 3, 3, 3, 2, 3, 3, 2, 3, 3, 2, 2, 3, 2, 2, 3, 2, 2, 3, 1, 0, 3, 1, 3, 1, 1, 3, 3, 1, 0]

Finally, I took all of the above genes (69 of them), and the ones and threes genes, and ranked all of them. The killer
gene ended up being the last one that I found, unsurprisingly. Good stuff!
